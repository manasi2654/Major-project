## ðŸ“„ Abstract  
Crowdfunding has revolutionized fundraising but remains plagued by fraud, lack of transparency, and inefficiencies due to centralized control. 
Crowdfunding Matrix leverages *blockchain technology and smart contracts* to create a decentralized, secure, and transparent crowdfunding platform. 
This model *eliminates intermediaries* , reducing costs and delays while ensuring trust less transactions.

Our system integrates *Ethereum-based smart contracts* to enable immutable financial records and decentralized governance.
The backend, developed using *Flask/FastAPI*, interacts with smart contracts, while the frontend, built with *React.js/Next.js* , provides an intuitive user experience with *MetaMask and Wallet Connect for authentication* .
IPFS ensures decentralized storage of project documents and proofs.
