TITLE : "The Next-Gen Crowdfunding DApp using Blockchain."

ABSTRACT: 
Crowdfunding has revolutionized fundraising but remains plagued by fraud, lack of transparency, and inefficiencies due to centralized control. 
Crowdfunding Matrix leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a decentralized, secure, and transparent crowdfunding platform. 
This model eliminates intermediaries, reducing costs and delays while ensuring trust less transactions.

Our system integrates Ethereum-based smart contracts (also supporting Polygon, Solana, or Binance Smart Chain) to enable immutable financial records and decentralized governance.
The backend, developed using Flask/FastAPI, interacts with smart contracts, while the frontend, built with React.js/Next.js, provides an intuitive user experience with MetaMask and Wallet Connect for authentication.
IPFS ensures decentralized storage of project documents and proofs.

A key feature of Crowdfunding Matrix is fraud detection and sentiment analysis using machine learning. 
The model analyzes campaign descriptions, donation patterns, and social engagement (Facebook shares, GoFundMe likes) to classify campaigns and detect anomalies. 
The dataset includes campaign details such as funding goals, donation history, and geographical data to enhance transparency and accountability.

REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY: Python(Flask), Blockchain(Ethereum),React.js/Next.js,IPFS.
