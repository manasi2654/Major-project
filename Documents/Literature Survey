Background

Crowdfunding is a method of raising funds from a large group of people via online platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, rather than relying on banks or investors. 
It allows project founders to quickly access capital while also generating public awareness and feedback.

However, traditional crowdfunding faces challenges like fraud, lack of transparency, and delayed rewards. 
Blockchain technology solves these issues by introducing decentralization, smart contracts, and transparency.

Advantages of Blockchain Crowdfunding:
Trust & Security: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, reducing fraud.
Smart Contracts: Automate fund distribution based on project milestones.
Global Access: Anyone can invest without intermediaries.
Faster & Cheaper: Reduces time and cost compared to traditional methods.

Existing Systems :
Several blockchain-based crowdfunding projects have been developed, each with advantages and drawbacks:
Shrishti Varshney et al.:
used the now-deprecated Goerli faucet, making the project irrelevant. However, it highlighted the importance of smart contracts.
Praharsh Churi et al.:
used Ethereum but faced challenges with MATICâ€™s low user base. A widely adopted cryptocurrency is essential for successful fundraising.
Sushanth Kumar Reddy Kura et al. :
emphasized the benefits of using Ether but lacked governance features, which could be addressed through smart contracts.
Swarup Chattopadhyay et al. :
discussed governance integration via smart contracts but mainly focused on Ether for fundraising.
Prof. Ujwala Gaikwad et al. :
used Polygon for fast transactions, but scalability was a limitation.
Firmansyah Ashari et al.:
highlighted smart contracts' role in automating fund distribution and removing third-party dependencies.
Syed Abdul Dalim et al.:
used Etherscan API for transparency but faced dependency issues and privacy concerns.
Singh Rawat et al. :
identified risks like fraud and misuse of funds in crowdfunding, stressing the need for better verification methods.
