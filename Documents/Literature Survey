Background

Crowdfunding is a method of raising funds from a large group of people via online platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, rather than relying on banks or investors. 
It allows project founders to quickly access capital while also generating public awareness and feedback.

However, traditional crowdfunding faces challenges like fraud, lack of transparency, and delayed rewards. 
Blockchain technology solves these issues by introducing decentralization, smart contracts, and transparency.

Advantages of Blockchain Crowdfunding:
Trust & Security: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, reducing fraud.
Smart Contracts: Automate fund distribution based on project milestones.
Global Access: Anyone can invest without intermediaries.
Faster & Cheaper: Reduces time and cost compared to traditional methods.

## Review of Existing Systems
*Kickstarter / GoFundMe* : Centralized platforms that host crowdfunding campaigns, control approval processes, and take a percentage of raised funds.
*Giveth* : A DApp focused on donations with built-in transparency and traceability using smart contracts.
*Fundition* : Uses blockchain to power donation-based fundraising with a social layer.
*WeiFund* : An early Ethereum-based DApp that explored decentralized crowdfunding.

## Limitations of Existing Systems
  ## Centralized Platforms:
Dependence on a trusted third party.
High service and transaction fees.
Vulnerable to censorship and platform bias.
Lack of financial transparency post-campaign.

  ## Early DApps:
Low adoption and poor UX compared to centralized platforms.
Limited scalability.
Dependency on specific tokens or chains.
Often lack milestone-based fund release mechanisms.
