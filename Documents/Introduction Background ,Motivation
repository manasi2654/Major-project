## Introduction
Crowdfunding has emerged as a powerful method for raising capital from a large number of individuals,
typically via online platforms.Traditional crowdfunding platforms, however, are often centralized,
requiring users to place their trust in a single intermediary that manages funds,enforces rules,
and governs interactions between project creators and backers.
These centralized systems are susceptible to issues such as high fees, 
lack of transparency, censorship, fraud, and single points of failure.

A Decentralized Application (DApp) for crowdfunding leverages blockchain technology and 
smart contracts to eliminate the need for a trusted third party.
By operating on a decentralized blockchain, such as Ethereum, the DApp allows for direct, 
peer-to-peer interactions, greater transparency,
and automatic enforcement of campaign rules via smart contracts. This ensures secure and trustless transactions,
democratizing access to capital while protecting both fundraisers and contributors.

## Background and Motivation
Traditional crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter or GoFundMe have shown the viability of collective funding models. 
However, they come with limitations:
*Centralized Control * : These platforms act as gatekeepers, with the authority to approve, suspend, or alter campaigns.
*High Fees* : A significant percentage of raised funds can be lost to platform fees and payment processing charges.
*Limited Transparency* : Contributors have limited visibility into how funds are being managed or spent after a campaign is funded.
*Geographical Restrictions* : Not all users worldwide have equal access to use or launch campaigns on centralized platforms.
Blockchain technology offers a compelling alternative. With smart contracts, crowdfunding rules can be coded and enforced automatically.
For example, funds can be released only when specific milestones are met, or refunded automatically if a campaign fails to reach its goal.
The motivation behind building a DApp for crowdfunding lies in creating a more transparent, secure, and inclusive funding environment.
It empowers users to raise or contribute funds with confidence, knowing the rules are enforced programmatically 
and the system is not controlled by any single party.
